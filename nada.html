    <li><b>Keep the Air Filter Clean:</b> A dirty air filter can restrict airflow, which can cause the evaporator coil to get too cold and freeze. To prevent this, clean or replace the air filter every one to three months, depending on usage.</li>
    <li><b>Check for Refrigerant Leaks:</b> Low refrigerant levels can cause the evaporator coil to freeze. If you notice frost or ice buildup on your AC unit, it may be due to low refrigerant levels caused by a leak. Contact a professional to check for leaks and recharge your AC system.</li>
    <li><b>Ensure Proper Airflow:</b> Make sure your AC unit has enough space around it for proper airflow. Keep furniture, curtains, and other obstructions away from the unit to ensure adequate airflow.</li>
    <li><b>Use a Programmable Thermostat:</b> A programmable thermostat can help regulate your home's temperature and humidity levels, preventing the evaporator coil from getting too cold and freezing up.
    </li>
    <li><b>Schedule Annual Maintenance:</b> Regular maintenance can help prevent frost and ice buildup on your AC unit. An HVAC professional can inspect and clean the evaporator coil, check refrigerant levels, and make necessary repairs or adjustments to keep your AC running smoothly.</li>
    <li><b>Install a Condensate Pan Heater:</b> In colder climates, a condensate pan heater can prevent the water in the pan from freezing and causing damage to your AC unit. This device helps keep the pan warm and prevents ice buildup.</li>
    <li><b>Insulate Pipes and Ductwork:</b> Insulating the pipes and ductwork that supply air to your AC unit can help prevent heat loss and keep the evaporator coil from getting too cold.</li>
