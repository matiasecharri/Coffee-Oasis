Chances are if it doesn't cool off soon you will be placing a service call to a local a/c service provider. The question is a matter not a matter of <em>if</em> but <em>when</em>. <a href="https://acadianacomfort.com/why-is-my-air-conditioner-running-but-not-cooling-the-house/">Why Is My Air Conditioner Running But Not Cooling The House?</a> When your a/c finally does fail in the hot summer heat, who do you call? At <a href="https://acadianacomfort.com/why-you-should-call-acadiana-comforts-for-your-heating-needs/">Acadiana Comfort</a> our goal is and always will be to provide you with transparency and our attempt a un-biased opinion. Therefore, we will not be including ourselves in the compiled list of <a href="https://acadianacomfort.com/" data-type="page" data-id="316">top air conditioning and heating companies in Lafayette, La</a>. <br />This list has been compiled according to the following information:<strong><br />A.) Reputation<br />B.) Products<br />C.) Time In The Market <br /></strong>Chances are if you're reading this you're probably already sweating. So lets get to it. <strong><em>Who are the best A/C companies in Lafayette, La?</em></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>1.) <a href="https://www.butcherac.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Butcher Air Conditioning</a></em></strong> - I doubt you're surprised by this one. If you have been living in this area for any amount of time you've probably done business with or at least heard of Butcher <a href="https://acadianacomfort.com/how-to-choose-an-air-conditioning-unit-that-is-right-for-you/">Air Conditioning</a>. There are a number of reasons why Butcher tops our list of Best A/C companies in Lafayette, La. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol>
<li><strong>They are a one stop shop</strong>. From service to installation, residential to commercial, even insulation. Yes they do it all. Not only do they do it all, but they have somehow been able to maintain a positive reputation while offer a broad range of products and services. </li>
<li><strong>Butcher has been around for a long time</strong>. As I write this Butcher has been <a href="https://acadianacomfort.com/air-conditioning-lafayette-la/a-c-service/">servicing the Lafayette</a>, La market for 68 years. This is important because it tells you, the consumer, that they are not going anywhere. It means you can depend on them to be there when you need them and in a climate of here today, gone tomorrow <a href="https://acadianacomfort.com/best-air-conditioning-company-in-the-area/">air conditioning companies</a> its important to know that there will always be someone available to answer your phone call. </li>
<li><strong>Butcher sells quality products</strong>. I cannot stress how important this is. Have you ever heard that saying "You get what you pay for." That has never been more true in this current economic market. Trane is a proven product that has been around for a very long time. They are a market leader in our industry. Most <a href="https://acadianacomfort.com/tips-for-choosing-the-right-tune-for-your-air-conditioning-system/">air conditioning</a> companies want to install the cheapest product at a premium, maximizing margin. Butcher installs a premium product at a premium price. I know, you were hoping I was going to say a cheaper price. Don't forget "You get what you pay for!" </li>

<p>Okay enough about Butcher, maybe the biggest company in town isn't your style. You want to hire someone who established but not so established. I get it, life can be monotonous at times, who doesn't like a little anarchy sprinkled into their day to day. That's why number 2 on our list is:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>2.) </strong><a href="https://airsource1.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Landry's Air Source 1</a><strong> - </strong>Landry's tops our list of best air conditioning companies in Lafayette, La for many of the same reason as their afore mentioned competitors. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol>
<li><strong>Landry's Air Source 1 sells a line of industry leading products</strong>, furthermore, their installation practices are top notch. Landry's utilizes a trunk and branch system that creates a long lasting, durable residential duct system. </li>
<li><strong>Landry's Air Source 1 has undergone a number of changes throughout the years</strong> starting out as Kincel's heating and cooling over 40 years ago. Kincel's became Landry's A/C and eventually Landry's Air Source One. Despite multiple transformations and an obvious evolution this <a href="https://acadianacomfort.com/which-ac-company-service-is-best/">company has the time in the market with 40 years of service</a> in the Lafayette, La market. </li>
<li><strong>Landry's Air Source 1 has the coolest trucks in town</strong>. Sorry, this blog is mostly un-biased but what can I say. I'm a sucker for aesthetics!</li>

<p>Last but not least on our list of the best A/C companies in Lafayette, La is:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>3.) </strong><a href="https://bremsenergy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brems Energy Solutions</a><strong> - </strong>What Brems A/C and Heating lacks in time in the market they make up for in services. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol>
<li><strong>What I really like about Brems A/C and Heating is their perspective on comfort. </strong>Most A/C businesses become so hyper focused on the equipment and the ductwork that they completely dis-regard one of the most important aspects of whole home comfort, insulation. A great A/C and <a href="https://acadianacomfort.com/the-best-heating-systems-for-your-home/">heating system</a> is always backed by a quality heat barrier, or at least the understanding of heat barriers and how they affect the way your a/c and heating system operates. This company is fast on its way to becoming the experts in our area. </li>
<li><strong>Brems A/C and Heating also sells a quality product</strong>, some in the industry may not agree, but Ruud has definitely marched to the beat of their own drum when it comes to design and technology. </li>
<li><strong>Brems A/C and Heating also has the experience over their short time in the market</strong>, they have grown quickly and completed some of the largest and more complicated projects in our area while still maintaining a family oriented small business feel and for these reasons Brems A/C and Heating lands at number 3 on our list of best A/C companies in the Lafayette, La.</li>
