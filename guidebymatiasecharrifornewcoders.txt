Day1:
In github, we had to create a new repo with a readme and a short description,
after that lets open the bash terminal and use:
-git init 
-git clone https://github.com/matiasecharri/Coffee-Oasis.git
Then we had the repo cloned in our pc.

After that we are going to create the index.html and add the "assets" folder for the images and the "style.css"

Now, we are going to push all of this new changes to github. 

Lets create a new branch: 
git branch nameofthenewbranch 
And lets move to this new branch: 
git checkout nameofthenewbranch
git add . (if you want to add all the changes)
git commit -m "a description of what you do" 
git push origin nameofthenewbranch
